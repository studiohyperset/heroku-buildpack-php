The `parallel_runtime_rspec.*.log` files in this directory are here on purpose.

They're test runtime logs generated by `parallel_tests`, and they are output at the end of a run.

They should, for each stack, periodically be copied from the test run logs and updated here in the repository, so that balanced grouping of test runs works well for minimal execution time.

It's important to include all spec files from the code in the list. You must fake entries if needed for files that are skipped completely (like the PHP series tests, which don't all run on every stack). Otherwise, parallel_tests will not balance things correctly - the --unknown-runtime=1 flag does not work.
